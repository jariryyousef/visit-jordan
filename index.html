  <h3 style="color:white;">AMMAN</h3>

  <p style="color:white;">Kick off your Jordan trip in the capital Amman, which is well connected with a modern, international airport and is only a few hours’ drive from cities like  Jerusalem.
    Home to four million people, the traffic-clogged city can be a sensory overload in some areas, and isn’t easily walkable due to steep hills and crumbling sidewalks. That said, there are a few sites worth seeing as well as easy day trips to historical, religiously-significant spots less than an hour away.</p>
