  <h3>AMMAN</h3>
  <p>Kick off your Jordan trip in the capital Amman, which is well connected with a modern, international airport and is only a few hours’ drive from cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

  Home to four million people, the traffic-clogged city can be a sensory overload in some areas, and isn’t easily walkable due to steep hills and crumbling sidewalks. That said, there are a few sites worth seeing as well as easy day trips to historical, religiously-significant spots less than an hour away.</p>
