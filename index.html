				<h3 style="color:white;">AMMAN</h3>

				<p style="color:white;">Kick off your Jordan trip in the capital Amman, which is well connected with a modern, international
					airport and is only a few hours’ drive from cities like Jerusalem. Home to four million people, the traffic-clogged
					city can be a sensory overload in some areas, and isn’t easily walkable due to steep hills and crumbling sidewalks.
					That said, there are a few sites worth seeing as well as easy day trips to historical, religiously-significant spots
					less than an hour away.</p>
